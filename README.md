# fractol
Just a simple fractal explorer with a couple basic fractals.

Use it by typing down an option such as -mandelbrot, then you can switch to any fractal available on the pannel to the right.
The window size cannot be changed for this project. I know it is sad.

DISCLAIMER : This is the project as it was given the first time it was validated at the school, it is not being updated since. I will keep those projects as they were made first.
